# Rust Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress in learning the Rust programming language.

## Project Structure

    - Contains examples for:
        - Variables and Mutability
        - Data Types
        - Functions
        - Control Flow

## How to Run

Navigate to the project directory and run:
